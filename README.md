# Lakehouse-MedIKal-Healthcare

## The main goal of this portfolio is to demo how to create a Lakehouse using Azure services. This new architecture and data storage paradigm combines the characteristics of both data warehouses and data lakes to create a UNIFIED basis for all types of use cases to be built on top of it. 
**Delta protocol** is the key ingredient that will offer features that span all fours system, DW, DL, Streaming, and Machine Learning.
Also, we want to avoid our data lake to become a data swamp or data silo, and [Delta](https://delta.io/) can help us create curated data lakes with reliability, performance, governance, and quality.
